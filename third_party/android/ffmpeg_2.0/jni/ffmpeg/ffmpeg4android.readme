Introduction
===========================================================================

FFmpeg for Android is a set of Android makefiles which enable configuration
and building FFmpeg library under Android source code tree with Android
NDK. It is also possible to build it without Android source code tree,
as part of your Android application.

While working as a system integrator, I have come upon more than few
Android ports of FFmpeg library. All of them have some non-features in
common:

- It is not possible to use configure script to configure the library. This
  may lead to invalid library configuration and output and degraded
  performance or feature set.
- Some FFmpeg libraries are missing. Usually, only libavutil, libavcodec
  and libavformat are built.
- FFmpeg tools (ffmpeg, ffplay, ffprobe, ffserver) are missing.
- Manually added files into Android.mk, usually without proper
  understanding of dependencies between files and function of each file
  in a library.
- Configuration is locked to single architecture.
- The library can not be built in parallel for different target products
  and architectures. This is important for large test environments.
- Missing or incomplete compiler and linker flags.
- Building library in a "It compiles = It is working" manner.
- Building library as a large single file.

This project is my attempt to address these and many other issues and
create makefiles for building FFmpeg library under Android source code tree
which will create output as close as possible to the output of "regular"
building process using standalone toolchain. These makefiles are result of
combining and extending various makefiles I have found on the web and
during my work.



Makefiles are tested and are working fine on:

Build host OS:      Ubuntu 10.04, Ubuntu 11.04
Android target OS:  Honeycomb, ICS, Android Master branch
Architecture:       arm, mips, x86
SDK + NDK release:  platform-11 + NDK-r6, platform-14 + NDK-r8
Product:            full-eng, full_mips-eng, full_x86-eng, and some
                    proprietary bleeding edge products
FFmpeg releases:    0.7.14, 0.8.12, 0.9.2, 0.10.6, 0.11.2, 1.0.4, 1.1.2,
                    HEAD-a34418c



===========================================================================
Features
===========================================================================

- On-the-fly library configuration. FFmpeg will be configured on-the-fly,
  during Android building process, in accordance to the selected product,
  cpu architecture, cpu architecture variant, and fine tuning cpu
  parameters.
- Configuration driven building. No need to manually add filenames to the
  makefiles, or hack through the library in order to get the build you
  want.
- Per product configuration. Every TARGET_PRODUCT will have its own
  configuration.
- Builds all libraries and tools, except ffplay.
- Builds both shared and static libraries.
- Builds latest releases form 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.10, 0.11, 1.0, 1.1 and HEAD
  branches.
- Supports parallel building from the same source for the different
  products.



===========================================================================
Known issues
===========================================================================

- None



===========================================================================
Note
===========================================================================

As number of FFmpeg branches grows, the load on my equipment for build
testing becomes overwhelming. At the same time, interest in older branches,
like 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.10, 0.11 is slim to none.

In the future, I may stop supporting branches 0.8, 0.9, 0.10 and 0.11.
I will keep 0.7, because it is the last 0.6 ABI compatible.



===========================================================================
Usage
===========================================================================

For use in Android source tree:

Extract ffmpeg-<version>.android.tar.gz into Android source code tree, at
location:

<android-src-root-dir>/external

Files will be located in:

<android-src-root-dir>/external/ffmpeg-<version>.android

Edit Android_configuration.mk and apply your customizations to the
./configure parameters, if needed.

Initialize Android build environment:

cd <android-src-root-dir>
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch <product>

To configure and build the library, run

make

or

cd external/ffmpeg-<version>.android; mm;

If there is no existing library configuration for a selected product, the
library will be configured on the fly, during building process, with
parameters provided in Android_configuration.mk. Whenever you change
configuration parameters, the library will be reconfigured.

Compiled FFmpeg libraries and tools will have version suffix, eg
libavcodec-1.0.a, libavutil-1.0.so, ffprobe-1.0


For use in standalone Android application:

Extract ffmpeg-<version>.android.tar.gz to your project, at location:

<project>/jni

Make following changes to the files in your project:

<project>/jni/Android.mk:

include $(call all-subdir-makefiles)
# note that you may not define any module here, in global Andorid.mk


<project>/jni/<your-lib>/Android.mk:

LOCAL_C_INCLUDES += jni/ffmpeg-1.1.2.android \
                    jni/ffmpeg-1.1.2.android/android/$(TARGET_ARCH_ABI)

LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES += avcodec-1.1.2 \
                          avdevice-1.1.2 \
                          avfilter-1.1.2 \
                          avformat-1.1.2 \
                          avresample-1.1.2 \
                          avutil-1.1.2 \
                          swresample-1.1.2 \
                          swscale-1.1.2


<project>/src/.../<your-main-Java-class>.java:

// Order is important, they depend on each other
String ffmpeg_libs[] = {
    "avutil-1.1.2",
    "avcodec-1.1.2",
    "avformat-1.1.2",
    "avresample-1.1.2",
    "swresample-1.1.2",
    "swscale-1.1.2",
    "avfilter-1.1.2",
    "avdevice-1.1.2"
};
for( String l : ffmpeg_libs ) {
    System.loadLibrary(l);
}


If you want to compile static FFmpeg libraries, add following changes to
<project>/jni/Android.mk:

FFMPEG_COMPILE_STATIC := yes
# You cannot compile both shared and static libraries.
FFMPEG_COMPILE_SHARED := no
# Enables GPL code in FFmpeg, your application must also be GPL-licensed.
FFMPEG_COMPILE_GPL := yes

include $(call all-subdir-makefiles)


If compilation fails because of missing header files, try running command

ndk-build -k

this should generate missing FFmpeg header files.

Also, you cannot compile for all architectures at the same time,
you have to specify only one architecture in APP_ABI in your Application.mk
for each compilation.



===========================================================================
Support
===========================================================================

Since Android is changing daily, and releases are tested only on a release
day, it is possible that after some time you will have issues with
building FFmpeg for Android.

Feel free to post on discussion board:
https://sourceforge.net/p/ffmpeg4android/discussion/

Feel free to report issues:
https://sourceforge.net/p/ffmpeg4android/tickets/

I will try to respond in a timely manner.



===========================================================================
Plan
===========================================================================

Short term plan is to test and update scripts to work on more architectures
and platforms.

Long term plan is to continue to provide scripts for latest FFmpeg library
releases, as they appear.

The Ultimate plan is to try to make scripts part of official FFmpeg
library, once they are stable and robust enough.



===========================================================================
License:
===========================================================================

Please, note that FFmpeg library and FFmpeg for Android makefiles for
building it under Android source code tree are two different projects.
FFmpeg for Android makefiles are licensed under whatever license You are
